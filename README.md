# Collision Playground

A web application that allows you to **interactively explore 2D collision detection** algorithms with a live code editor and visualization canvas.

---

## Features

- **Monaco Editor Integration**: View and edit C++ collision detection code directly in the browser.
- **Interactive Canvas**: Visualize collisions between shapes in real time using the Canvas API.
- **WebAssembly (WASM) Powered**: Collision functions are compiled from C++ using Emscripten for high-performance execution.
- **Multiple Collision Types**: Easily add and experiment with different collision detection algorithms.
- **Live Feedback**: Changes in code can be immediately reflected on the canvas for quick experimentation.
